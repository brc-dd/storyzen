'<p>\
A minimalist write and publish zone, where you can block out all distractions and get to what\'s important.\
</p>\
<p> \
	To get started, all you need to do is delete this text (seriously, just highlight it and hit delete), and fill the page with your own fantastic words and when you\'re done just press the publish button, present on the top right corner... It will redirect you to your published story! \
</p> \
<p> \
	You can use <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, <b><i>both</i></b> and <a href="http://zenpen.io"> urls </a> just by highlighting the text and selecting them from the tiny options box that appears above it.\
</p>\
<blockquote>\
	Quotes are easy to add too!\
</blockquote>\

<p>Happy Writing! ~ <b>Tim Holman (@twholman)</b> and <b>Divyansh Singh(@brc-dd)</b></p>\
